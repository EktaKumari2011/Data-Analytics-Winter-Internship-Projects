- Accept user input for selecting the position of the frog to move.
- Check the validity of the selected move based on the game rules.
- Make the appropriate move by updating the game display.
- Implement winning and losing conditions for the game.

### How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Python script to start the Frog Leap game.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to make moves and try to solve the puzzle.
